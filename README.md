# Search-Engine-Indexer

The Indexer Engine is implemented using C programming. It indexes the HTML file links that are downloaded through
the Search Engine Crawler.

It works as mapping each of the HTML link and ranking them based on the most visited ones.
The ranking part can be changed as per programmer's view.
